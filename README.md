This is for the Udacity Optimization project.  The finalized and optimized files are in the 'dest' folder.

Open index.html to view the website optimizations and observe a Google Pagespeed score over 90.

Then click into the pizzeria link and observe a FPS of 60 when scrolling.  Also when resizing the pizzas they should load in under 5ms.

Main.js was updated with a few tweaks to grab DOM elements more efficiently as well as updating some for loops to perform faster.

Gulp was used to minify images and to add inline css in order to increase page speed.
